# cassandra-dev-news-agent

Apache CassandraÂ® is a highly dynamic and large project. With many developers working on bugs and features, it's hard to keep track of all the changes. Cassandra Dev News Agent is a AI Agent that gathers from all the sources of change and tries to distill it down for the user community so they can keep track of the latest goings on in the project. 

## Sources of information
 - When a feature change is made to the code base, committers also update the CHANGES.TXT file found here: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/CHANGES.txt
 - In the CHANGES.TXT file, the changes are sectioned by Cassandra version number and in some cases, anything merged forward will have a duplicate
 - Changes are also reference a Jira number. For example a change like this "Expose current compaction throughput in nodetool (CASSANDRA-13890)" Points to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-13890
 - Jira entries are required for any change to the system. The include a lot of detail about the change, discussion on the solution, test data and in some cases, images that show visual infromation. 
 - Longer term changes are previewed and discussed in a Cassandra Enhancement Proposal or CEP. 
 - CEPs are officially listed here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=95652201
 - While CEPs are undergoing discussion, the drafts will be written here. You can look at the CEP under status and "Current state: " to see where the current proposal lies
 - Additionaly the mailing list is also a place to see the changes, however those tend to be discussions that turn into a CEP or Jira. Much more dynamic and more noise than signal. 
 - Voting is an important part of the mailing list and is very useful information for users. Every version release and CEP is voted on via the dev mailing list found here. https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@cassandra.apache.org
 - Each proceedural email has a particular tag in the subject [DISCUSS] for discussions about features and CEPs. [VOTE] to facilitate  voting. [ANNOUNCE] for offical project announements such as a version release. [RESULT] to finalize a vote thread and announce to users the final tally.

## Why an agent for this task?

An agentic AI system  offers the right kind of flexibilty to run a workflow of retrieve, decide, act, learn and notify.

Retrieve - Gather information from sources
Decide - Using an LLM, reason and decide on the next steps.
Act - Based on the decisions in the agentics step, act on those decisions
Learn - Update any system that needs to change based on new information
Notify - Output final result

## Initial goal of the system
Our first goal is to build a system that will gather development changes in teh Cassandra project and create a blog page once a week. Every Friday, users can see what they missed for the week. How detailed we get is based on how relevent the change is. This will have to be learned over time and the feedback will be on how frequent the changes are. If it's too much info weekly, we'll try daily. Not enough? We'll try every week.
